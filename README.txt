This project was started and takes inspiration from the 'contacts-app-v4' example created by Dr. Amilcar Soares. It has inherited the model-view-controller pattern that
Dr. Soares used in that example. This was originally a group project for COMP3100 'Web Development' taught by Dr. Edward Brown, however I have removed all contributions by my partner
so that it now reflects only my work, skill, and knowledge.
